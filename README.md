# HuffmanCoding
## Final Project for Data Stuctures class at Duke University
Fully functioning compression and decompression. Bulk of code is in the HuffProcessor class <br>
Compression utilizes a prefix tree made using a greedy algorithm. More frequently occurring <br>
characters are coded with fewer bits. <br>
Download the code to try and compress/decompress your own files with the HuffMain classes!
